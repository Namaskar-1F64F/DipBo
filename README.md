## Hi, I'm DipBo!

I am able to watch a diplomacy game and give you updates on the game. To get started, find the game ID (found in the URL of a game). After that, send in this chat `/monitor <GAME_ID>` to start getting updates from me!

To stop monitoring, send the command `/stop` and I'll leave you alone :(

Questions? t.me/svendog

Here are the .env variables you need to set up! If you don't include a specific TOKEN, that bot will not run :)

```
LOG_DIRECTORY
REFRESH_INTERVAL_MINUTES
MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING
DIPLOMACY_DISCORD_TOKEN
DIPLOMACY_TELEGRAM_TOKEN
```
